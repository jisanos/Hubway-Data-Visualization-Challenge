An attempt to the Hubway Data Visualization Challenge to hone my Data Science skills

I recommend downloading the html export to see everything propperly (the maps and stuff). Use Firefox browser, as Chromium based browsers tend to not show maps very well.

If you wish to see the maps and use the googleAPI functions you must create a google API key and enter it in the string where I used my API key, as the one I used is obviously restricted for private reasons.

The csv's used can be found at the following:
